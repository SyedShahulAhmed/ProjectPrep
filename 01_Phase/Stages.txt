Perfect ðŸš€ â€” hereâ€™s a *clear roadmap of all stages* for your MERN journey, step by step.
We already *finished Stage 1*, and this list will guide us through the rest.

---

# ðŸŸ¢ Stage 1: React (Frontend Basics) âœ… Completed

*Goal:* Build a frontend-only Task Manager with CRUD in React.
*Tasks:*

1. Setup project with *Vite + Tailwind*
2. Display hardcoded tasks
3. Add new task (state)
4. Delete task
5. Toggle complete/incomplete
6. Update task (edit)
7. (Optional) Save tasks in *localStorage*

---

# ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2: Express + MongoDB (Backend Basics)

*Goal:* Build a backend API for tasks.
*Tasks:*

1. Setup Node.js + Express project
2. Connect to *MongoDB* (Atlas or local) with *Mongoose*
3. Create Task model (text, completed)
4. Build CRUD API routes:

   * GET /tasks â†’ get all tasks
   * POST /tasks â†’ create task
   * PUT /tasks/:id â†’ update task
   * DELETE /tasks/:id â†’ delete task
5. Test API with *Postman / Thunder Client*

---

# ðŸŸ  Stage 3: Connect Frontend â†” Backend

*Goal:* Replace Reactâ€™s local state with real backend data.
*Tasks:*

1. Install Axios in frontend
2. Fetch tasks from backend (useEffect)
3. Add tasks with POST request
4. Update tasks with PUT request
5. Delete tasks with DELETE request
6. Handle loading & error states

---

# ðŸ”µ Stage 4: Authentication (Optional, but real-world)

*Goal:* Add user accounts so each user manages their own tasks.
*Tasks:*

1. Create User model (username, password)
2. Auth routes:

   * POST /register
   * POST /login (with JWT)
3. Protect task routes â†’ tasks linked to user ID
4. In frontend: add login/register forms
5. Store JWT in localStorage & send with requests

---

# ðŸŸ£ Stage 5: Extra Features (Nice-to-Have)

*Goal:* Make it feel like a real app.
*Ideas:*

* Task categories / priorities
* Search & filter tasks
* Pagination or infinite scroll
* Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify) + backend (Render/Heroku)

---

âœ… With these 5 stages, youâ€™ll go from *beginner â†’ full-stack MERN developer* with a solid Task Manager project to showcase.

Do you want me to *save this roadmap* so tomorrow we can start *Stage 2: Express + MongoDB* directly?
